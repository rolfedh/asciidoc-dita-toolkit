= What is containerization

Containerization is a method of virtualization that packages applications with their dependencies.

== Key concepts

Containers provide several benefits:

* Isolation between applications
* Consistent environments across development and production
* Efficient resource utilization
* Simplified deployment processes

== How it works

Unlike traditional virtual machines, containers share the host operating system kernel while maintaining process isolation.
