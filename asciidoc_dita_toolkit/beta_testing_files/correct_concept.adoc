= System architecture overview

This concept provides an overview of the system architecture.

The system follows a modular architecture pattern that separates concerns and enables scalability.

== Architecture layers

The system consists of three main layers:

Presentation layer:: Handles user interaction and displays information
Business logic layer:: Processes requests and enforces business rules  
Data layer:: Manages data storage and retrieval

== Benefits

This layered approach provides:

* Clear separation of concerns
* Improved maintainability
* Enhanced scalability
* Better testability

Understanding this architecture helps developers work effectively with the system.
