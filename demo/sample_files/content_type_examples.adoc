= Content Type Detection Examples
:doctype: article

== Introduction

This document demonstrates the ContentType plugin functionality. It shows how the plugin automatically detects and assigns appropriate content type labels based on filename patterns, titles, and content analysis.

== Current Status

NOTE: This file currently has no `:_mod-docs-content-type:` attribute set. The ContentType plugin should detect this and suggest an appropriate content type based on the filename and content.

== Document Types the Plugin Can Detect

=== Procedure Documents

Files named with patterns like:
* `proc-*` or `procedure-*`
* `how-to-*` or `howto-*`
* `*-procedure.adoc`
* `*-steps.adoc`

Content indicators:
* Step-by-step instructions
* Numbered procedures
* "How to" titles

=== Reference Documents

Files named with patterns like:
* `ref-*` or `reference-*`
* `*-reference.adoc`
* `*-api.adoc`
* `*-spec.adoc`

Content indicators:
* API documentation
* Configuration references
* Specification documents

=== Concept Documents

Files named with patterns like:
* `con-*` or `concept-*`
* `*-concept.adoc`
* `*-overview.adoc`
* `about-*.adoc`

Content indicators:
* Explanatory content
* Overview information
* Conceptual topics

=== Assembly Documents

Files named with patterns like:
* `assembly-*`
* `*-assembly.adoc`
* `guide-*`
* `*-guide.adoc`

Content indicators:
* Collections of related topics
* User guides
* Multi-part documentation

== Interactive Features

The ContentType plugin offers different interaction modes:

=== Quiet Mode
* Automatically assigns "TBD" to unknown types
* No user interaction required
* Perfect for batch processing

=== Interactive Mode
* Prompts user for content type selection
* Provides suggestions based on analysis
* Allows custom content type input

=== Legacy Mode
* Enhanced UI with emojis and decorative elements
* Detailed feedback and progress indication
* Full-featured interactive experience

== Content Analysis Features

The plugin analyzes:

1. **Filename patterns** - Automatically detects based on common naming conventions
2. **Title analysis** - Looks for keywords in document titles
3. **Content patterns** - Scans document content for type indicators
4. **Existing attributes** - Respects manually set content types

== Example Scenarios

=== Scenario 1: Procedure Document
```
Filename: proc-install-software.adoc
Title: How to Install the Software
Content: Contains numbered steps and procedures
Expected: :_mod-docs-content-type: procedure
```

=== Scenario 2: Reference Document
```
Filename: ref-api-endpoints.adoc
Title: API Reference
Content: Contains API documentation and specifications
Expected: :_mod-docs-content-type: reference
```

=== Scenario 3: Concept Document
```
Filename: con-architecture-overview.adoc
Title: Architecture Overview
Content: Contains explanatory and conceptual information
Expected: :_mod-docs-content-type: concept
```

=== Scenario 4: Assembly Document
```
Filename: assembly-user-guide.adoc
Title: Complete User Guide
Content: Contains multiple related topics
Expected: :_mod-docs-content-type: assembly
```

== Detection Confidence Levels

The plugin provides confidence levels for its suggestions:

* **High Confidence** (90-100%): Clear filename pattern + matching content
* **Medium Confidence** (70-89%): Partial pattern match or content indicators
* **Low Confidence** (50-69%): Weak indicators, user input recommended
* **Unknown** (<50%): No clear indicators, defaults to "TBD" or prompts user

== Batch Processing Support

The ContentType plugin supports:

* **Recursive processing** - Processes entire directory trees
* **Selective processing** - Processes only files matching patterns
* **Backup creation** - Optional backup of original files
* **Progress reporting** - Real-time processing feedback

== Expected Plugin Behavior

When this file is processed by the ContentType plugin:

1. **Filename analysis**: `content_type_examples.adoc` doesn't match standard patterns
2. **Title analysis**: "Content Type Detection Examples" suggests documentation/reference content
3. **Content analysis**: Contains explanatory content about the plugin itself
4. **Likely assignment**: `:_mod-docs-content-type: reference` or `:_mod-docs-content-type: concept`

The plugin will add the appropriate content type attribute at the top of the file, after the title and before the first content section.

== Integration with Other Plugins

The ContentType plugin works well with:

* **EntityReference**: Processes entity references before content type assignment
* **DirectoryConfig**: Respects directory-specific content type configurations
* **ContextAnalyzer**: Provides additional context for content type determination

== Configuration Options

The plugin can be configured with:

* **Custom filename patterns** - Add organization-specific naming conventions
* **Custom content patterns** - Define custom content type indicators
* **Default content types** - Set fallback values for unknown types
* **UI preferences** - Choose interaction mode (quiet, interactive, legacy)
