== Introduction

This document demonstrates the EntityReference plugin functionality. It contains various HTML character entity references that should be replaced with AsciiDoc attribute references.

== Common HTML Entities (Before Processing)

The following entities will be replaced by the EntityReference plugin:

* Copyright symbol: &copy; 2024 Example Corp
* Trademark symbol: MyProduct&trade; is amazing
* Registered trademark: AnotherProduct&reg; works great
* Degree symbol: The temperature is 25&deg;C
* Em dash: This is a long sentence &mdash; with an em dash
* En dash: Pages 10&ndash;20 contain the details
* Ellipsis: And so on&hellip;

== Quotation Marks

* Left double quote: &ldquo;This is a quote&rdquo;
* Left single quote: &lsquo;This is a quote&rsquo;
* Right double quote: &rdquo;This is the end&rdquo;
* Right single quote: &rsquo;This is the end&rsquo;

== Mathematical and Technical Symbols

* Plus sign: 5&plus;3=8
* Multiplication: 5&times;3=15
* Division: 15&divide;3=5
* Paragraph symbol: See section &para;3.2
* Section symbol: Reference &sect;4.1
* Bullet point: Item 1 &bull; Item 2 &bull; Item 3
* Middle dot: File&middot;name&middot;extension

== Currency and Special Characters

* Pound sterling: &pound;25.99
* Broken bar: This&brvbar;that
* Left angle quote: &laquo;French style quotes&raquo;
* Right angle quote: &raquo;End of French quotes&laquo;
* Single left angle: &lsaquo;Single angle&rsaquo;
* Single right angle: &rsaquo;End single angle&lsaquo;

== Daggers and References

* Dagger: See footnote&dagger;
* Double dagger: See footnote&Dagger;

== Supported XML Entities (Should NOT be replaced)

These entities are supported in DITA and should remain unchanged:

* Ampersand: &amp; (should stay as &amp;)
* Less than: &lt; (should stay as &lt;)
* Greater than: &gt; (should stay as &gt;)
* Apostrophe: &apos; (should stay as &apos;)
* Quotation mark: &quot; (should stay as &quot;)

== Comments Section

// This is a single-line comment with entities that should NOT be processed
// Copyright &copy; and trademark &trade; in comments should stay unchanged

////
This is a block comment with entities that should NOT be processed:
- Copyright &copy; 2024
- Trademark &trade; symbol
- Registered &reg; mark
- Degree &deg; symbol
////

== Mixed Content

Here's a complex example with mixed content:

The new MyProduct&trade; version 2.0 costs &pound;199.99 and includes a &copy; 2024 license. 
Temperature range: -10&deg;C to +50&deg;C. 
For more information, see pages 15&ndash;32 in the manual&hellip;

// Comment: This &copy; should not be changed
The software supports both &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; and &lsquo;manual&rsquo; modes.

== Expected Results After Processing

After running the EntityReference plugin, all the HTML entities above (except those in comments and the XML entities) should be replaced with their corresponding AsciiDoc attribute references like `{copy}`, `{trade}`, `{reg}`, etc.

The comments should remain unchanged, and the XML entities (&amp;, &lt;, &gt;, &apos;, &quot;) should also remain unchanged as they are supported in DITA.
