# Optimization request template

 To get the best results when asking for a repository-wide review and cleanup, it's helpful to be as specific as possible.

Here is a template you can use and adapt:

---

"Please perform a comprehensive review of the entire `asciidoc-dita-toolkit` repository and apply fixes for the following categories of issues:

1. **Dead Code:** Identify and remove any unused functions, classes, methods, variables, and imports.
2. **Redundant Logic:** Refactor any code that is duplicated or unnecessarily complex.
3. **Readability and Maintainability:** Improve code clarity by simplifying complex expressions, improving comments, and adhering to a consistent style.
4. **Best Practices:** Ensure the code follows modern Python best practices, including proper error handling and idiomatic constructs.

Please apply the necessary changes directly to the files. For any significant or potentially breaking changes, please ask for my confirmation before proceeding."

---

**Why this is effective:**

* **Clear Scope:** It specifies the "entire repository."
* **Specific Goals:** It lists concrete categories of issues to look for (dead code, redundancy, etc.).
* **Action-Oriented:** It clearly states the desired outcome (apply fixes directly).
* **Provides a Safeguard:** It asks for confirmation on major changes, giving you control over the process.

By using a detailed prompt like this, you provide clear instructions, which helps me understand your intent and carry out the task more accurately and efficiently.

Would you like me to proceed with a repository-wide cleanup based on the prompt above?
