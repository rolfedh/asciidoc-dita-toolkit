# Agentic Code Review Prompts

This document contains a collection of prompts to guide AI-assisted code review and optimization for the `asciidoc-dita-toolkit` project. Use these prompts with GitHub Copilot or other AI coding assistants to ensure thorough, professional code review.

## Quick Review Commands

### Basic Review
```
Please perform a comprehensive code review of the current branch/PR focusing on:
1. Code quality and Python best practices
2. Potential bugs or runtime errors
3. Breaking changes and backwards compatibility
4. Documentation accuracy and completeness
5. Test coverage gaps
```

### Detailed Architecture Review
```
Act as a senior software architect and review this code for:
- Design patterns and architectural consistency
- SOLID principles adherence
- Code organization and module separation
- API design and usability
- Performance implications
- Security considerations
- Maintainability and extensibility
```

## Specific Review Categories

### üêõ Bug Detection and Error Handling
```
Analyze the code for potential issues:
- Missing imports or circular dependencies
- Unhandled exceptions and error cases
- Type mismatches and runtime errors
- Resource leaks (file handles, memory)
- Edge cases in input validation
- Null/None pointer issues
- Logic errors in conditional statements

For each issue found, provide:
- File name and line number
- Specific problem description
- Suggested fix with code example
- Severity level (critical/high/medium/low)
```

### üîÑ Refactoring Opportunities
```
Identify refactoring opportunities:
- Code duplication (DRY principle violations)
- Functions/classes that are too large or complex
- Poor naming conventions
- Magic numbers and hardcoded values
- Nested conditional complexity
- Opportunities for extraction of reusable components
- Dead code elimination

Suggest specific refactoring steps with before/after examples.
```

### üìö Documentation and Type Safety
```
Review documentation and type safety:
- Missing or inaccurate docstrings
- Unclear function/class descriptions
- Missing type hints
- Inconsistent documentation style
- Example code in docstrings
- README and user-facing documentation accuracy
- Code comments that explain "why" not just "what"

Suggest improvements with proper Python docstring format examples.
```

### üß™ Testing and Quality Assurance
```
Evaluate testing coverage and quality:
- Missing test cases for new functionality
- Edge cases that should be tested
- Test code quality and maintainability
- Mock usage appropriateness
- Integration vs unit test balance
- Test naming conventions
- Setup/teardown patterns

Suggest specific test cases that should be added.
```

### ‚ö° Performance and Optimization
```
Analyze for performance issues:
- Inefficient algorithms or data structures
- Unnecessary loops or redundant operations
- Memory usage patterns
- I/O operations that could be optimized
- Caching opportunities
- Lazy loading possibilities
- Database query optimization (if applicable)

Provide performance improvement suggestions with estimated impact.
```

### üîí Security Review
```
Conduct a security-focused review:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Path traversal vulnerabilities
- Command injection possibilities
- File access permissions
- Error message information leakage
- Dependency security considerations
- Secrets handling

Flag potential security issues with mitigation strategies.
```

### üèóÔ∏è API Design and Usability
```
Evaluate API design and developer experience:
- Function signature clarity and consistency
- Parameter naming and ordering
- Return value patterns
- Error handling approaches
- Breaking changes in public APIs
- Backwards compatibility maintenance
- CLI interface usability
- Configuration file handling

Suggest improvements for better developer experience.
```
