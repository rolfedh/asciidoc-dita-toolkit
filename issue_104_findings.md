# Issue 104 - AsciiDoc DITA Toolkit Investigation

## Summary
I investigated the reference to issue 104 from the asciidoc-dita-toolkit repository but was unable to locate the specific issue through the GitHub API or web search.

## Repository Information
- **Repository**: `rolfedh/asciidoc-dita-toolkit`
- **Current workspace**: Confirmed to be the correct repository
- **Repository structure**: Python-based toolkit for processing AsciiDoc files for DITA publishing

## What I Found
The asciidoc-dita-toolkit is a command-line tool that:
- Finds and fixes common issues in `.adoc` files before publishing
- Applies automated checks and transformations using a plugin system
- Ensures consistency across large documentation projects
- Integrates with existing documentation workflows

### Current Available Plugins
1. **EntityReference**: Replace unsupported HTML character entity references with AsciiDoc attribute references
2. **ContentType**: Add `:_mod-docs-content-type:` labels where missing, based on filename

## Issue 104 Status
- **Issue not found**: The specific issue 104 could not be retrieved via GitHub API
- **Possible reasons**:
  - Issue might not exist yet
  - Issue might be private or restricted
  - Issue might have been deleted or renumbered
  - API access limitations

## Next Steps
To properly address issue 104, I would need:
1. **Direct access** to the issue content or description
2. **Issue details** such as:
   - What problem needs to be solved
   - What plugin needs to be created or modified
   - What specific functionality is requested
3. **Test cases** or examples of the issue
4. **Expected behavior** vs actual behavior

## Repository Analysis
The current codebase shows:
- Well-structured Python project with proper packaging
- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- Comprehensive documentation
- Docker support for containerized usage
- Automated testing and CI/CD setup

## Recommendations
1. **Provide issue details**: Share the specific content or description of issue 104
2. **Define requirements**: Clarify what needs to be implemented or fixed
3. **Example files**: Provide sample AsciiDoc files that demonstrate the issue
4. **Expected output**: Show what the desired behavior should be

Without the specific issue details, I cannot proceed with implementation but am ready to help once the requirements are clarified.
